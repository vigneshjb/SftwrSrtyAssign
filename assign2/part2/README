I used the second hint to a large extent and the most
of the solution was available on the class forum. 

The following steps will let us break the code.
 1) create the python program for reading the file
 2) use cksum to get the hash of the file
 3) encrypt the file using the public key

I noticed that the decryption doesn't require to 
specify the key that needs to be used. This combined 
with the fact that the server is not comparing with 
a hash that is already there on the server lead to 
the easy breaking of the site.
